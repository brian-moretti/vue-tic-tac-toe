# Vue Project - Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to my first Vue project for Start2Impact University.

## The Project: Classic Tic Tac Toe

Even if not requested, the user can decide which icon (cross / circle) go first.
After selected the user will play tic tac toe.

If 3 fields with the same icon are aligned the game ends with a victory otherwise the game ends in a tie.
The user can reset the game and start again
